Repository for the paper "De Benedictis, L., Rondinelli, R., Vinciotti, V. (2022). Cultures as networks of cultural traits: A unifying framework for measuring culture and cultural distances. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A."

The R objects contained in the R Project allow each script to be run even singularly, i.e., although there is a chronological order of the scripts, you do not need to run the previous ones in order to obtain a specific output.

Note: this is true if you want to use our elaborations about bdgraph, otherwise you need to follow and run the "03.BDgraph_infer-networks.R" script to generate your BDgraph objects. 

Note: The text font we made use for the Figures of the paper is "LM Roman 10", here, to avoid problems with the R compilation of the code under different Operating System, we consider the default text font of R.
