Repository for the paper "Luca De Benedictis, Roberto Rondinelli, Veronica Vinciotti, Cultures as networks of cultural traits: a unifying framework for measuring culture and cultural distances. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A: Statistics in Society. 2023. https://doi.org/10.1093/jrsssa/qnac007"

The R objects contained in the R Project allow each script to be run individually, i.e., although there is a chronological order of the scripts, you do not need to run the previous ones in order to obtain a specific output.

Note: file "distances_WVS-W6.csv" contains the cultural distances for each pair of countries denoted by their extended names and by their iso3 international code. This file makes cultural distances available for different elements:
- each marginal distribution of the considered cultural traits defined in Table 1;
- "JD marginals", the first additive component of the "JD index" derived in Equation 7;
- "JD network", the second additive component of the "JD index" derived in Equation 7;
- "JD index" derived in Equation 7;
- "Mean diff", the Euclidean norm of the differences between the vector of means of the cultural traits;
- "IW index", an alternative measure of cultural distances describing the Euclidean distances between cultural traits in the reproducted Inglehartâ€“Welzel Cultural Map (Figure 2).

Note: this is true if you want to use our elaborations of the graphical models from BDgraph. Otherwise you need to follow and run the "03.BDgraph_infer-networks.R" script to generate your BDgraph objects. 

Note: The text font we made use for the Figures of the paper is "LM Roman 10". Here, to avoid problems with the R compilation of the code under different Operating System, we consider the default text font of R.
