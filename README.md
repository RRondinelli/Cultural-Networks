The R objects contained in the R Project allow each script to be run even singularly, i.e., although there is a chronological order of the scripts, you do not need to run the previous ones in order to obtain a specific output.

Note: this is true if you want to use our elaborations about bdgraph, otherwise you need to follow and run the "03.BDgraph_infer-networks.R" script to generate your BDgraph objects.
